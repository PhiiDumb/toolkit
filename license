Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International

This license is the most restrictive Creative Commons license, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.

Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes. 

NoDerivatives — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.

No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits. 

This license may not be the most appropriate license for software, as software is often distributed as a binary executable, which is not covered by the license.
